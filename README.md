# wifi-p2p-streaming

## About the Project üí°

This project demonstrates how to connect and share data between devices using Wifi-direct. 
This wraps all framework's Wifi-direct and CameraX APIs and packs into Android library modules for fast and convenient use.

**Technical specification**:
* Support peer-to-peer connection via `Wifi-direct`.
* Data transmission via `Datagram socket (UDP)`.
* Build with `CameraX` APIs.
* Support video recording on client side with `AVC(H264)` encoder.
* Improve performance.

**Upcoming road map**:
* Add support for other protocols: `Streaming socket (TCP)`, `RTSP (Real Time Streaming Protocol)`.
* Add streaming quality selections: `SD`, `HD`, `Full HD`.
* Add support for other encoders: `HEVC(H265)`, `MPEG4`.

## Built on üõ†
**[android-core-architecture-lite](https://github.com/anhhn2312/android-core-architecture-lite)**
A complete code base that helps to fast build a small app (demo, test) in a modern and high performance way.
